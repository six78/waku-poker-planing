### Description

Planning poker is a gamified way for a team to estimate a task blindly, i.e. each participant does not know what estimate the others have given.

There are two roles in this application: **player** and **dealer**. Player just receives an item and estimates it. Dealer is a player with some extended rights to manage vote process like creating items, starting estimation process, revealing the results and selecting of final estimate
